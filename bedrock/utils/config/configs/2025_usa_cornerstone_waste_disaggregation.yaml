# This config runs the Cornerstone 2026 model schema with waste disaggregation
# enabled. Waste disaggregation splits sector 562000 into 7 sub-sectors using
# weights from WasteDisaggregationDetail2017_Make.csv and WasteDisaggregationDetail2017_Use.csv.
#
# IMPORTANT: Disaggregation logic must consult get_usa_config().implement_waste_disaggregation
# and cannot proceed without this flag being True. Load this config file via
# set_global_usa_config("2025_usa_cornerstone_waste_disaggregation") to enable
# weight-based waste disaggregation in the EEIO pipeline.
